# Lab2: JavaFX Basics

## Q1: Display a string around a circle (From textbook Q14.5)
Write a program that displays a string “Welcome to Java” around the circle, as shown below. 



HINT: You need to display each character in the right location with appropriate rotation using a loop, treat a blank space a one character


## Q2: Display three distinct random cards (From textbook Q14.3)
Write a program that displays three cards randomly selected from a deck of 52, as shown below. 

![show 3 distinct random cards](./images/3cards.png)

The card image files are named 1.png, 2.png, . . . , 52.png and stored in the [image/card directory](https://github.com/ufidon/java/tree/main/bookmedia/image/card). All three cards are distinct and selected randomly. 

HINT: You can select random cards by storing the numbers 1–52 to an array list, perform a random shuffle introduced in textbook [Section 11.12](../../mod1/Array.md), and use the first three numbers in the array list as the file names for the image.
