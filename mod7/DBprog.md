# Java Database Programming
- [Chapter 34](../bookextra/ch34.pdf)

Prerequisites: Setup MySQL
---
- Download and install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
  - Setup with all default options, close XAMPP Control Panel if it runs after installation
  - Run XAMPP Control Panel as Administrator , start MySQL, click Shell, setup a password for root
    ```cmd
     mysqladmin -u root password <your_password>
    ```
  - Check MySQL works, in the previous shell (a command window)
    ```cmd
    mysql -u root -p
    :: enter your password
    :: if you see Welcome to the MariaDB monitor, MySQL works.
    ```
- Download [MySQL Connector/J](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.mysql/mysql-connector-j) jar file and save it in the same folder as your source code for simplicity
- Run the sample Java program below to test the database development environment is setup completely.

```java
// test MySQL is accessible with MySQL Connector/J
// 0. put mysql-connector-j-8.0.31.jar in the same folder as TestCon.java
// 1. Run from Visual Studio Code:
// add  mysql-connector-j-8.0.31.jar to Reference libraries
// 2. Run from command line:
// java -classpath ".;mysql-connector-j-8.0.31.jar"   TestCon
import java.sql.*;

class TestCon {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    try {
      Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
      Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(
          "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test", "root", "your_password");
      if (con == null) {
        System.out.println("Something wrong with the database development environment.");
        return;
      } else {
        System.out.println("You are good to go.");
        con.close();
      }
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.out.println(e);
    }
  }
}
```


Objectives
---
- Explain the concepts of
  - database and database management systems 
  - the relational data model
    - relational data structures, constraints, and languages 
- use SQL to create and drop tables
  - to retrieve and modify data
- load a driver, connect to a database, 
  - execute statements, and process result sets using JDBC 
  - use prepared statements to execute precompiled SQL statements 
  - use callable statements to execute stored SQL procedures and functions 
- explore database metadata using the DatabaseMetaData and ResultSetMetaData interfaces

Rational Database based on Relational Data Model
---
- A relational data model has three key components: 
  - **Structure** defines the representation of the data
  - **Integrity** imposes constraints on the data
  - **Language** provides the means for accessing and manipulating data


Relational Structure
---
- A relational database consists of a set of relations
- A relation has two things:
  - a schema defines the relation 
  - an instance is the content of the relation at a given time 
    - nothing more than a table with rows and named columns 
    - simply refer instances of relations as just relations or tables


Integrity Constraints
---
- impose conditions that all legal relations must satisfy
- three types of constraints: 
  - A Domain constraint and a primary key constraint
    - intra-relational constraint
    - involves only one relation 
  - A foreign key constraint 
    - inter-relational
    - involves more than one relation


Domain constraints 
---
- specify the permissible values for an attribute
  - using standard data types such as 
    - integers, floating-point numbers, 
    - fixed-length strings, and variant-length strings. 
  - specify whether an attribute can be null


Domain Constraints Example
---

```sql
create table Course (
  courseId char(5),
  subjectId char(4) not null, 
  courseNumber integer, 
  title varchar(50) not null, 
  numOfCredits integer, 
  constraint greaterThanOne 
       check (numOfCredits >= 1));
```
